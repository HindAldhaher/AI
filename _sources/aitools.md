Introduction to AI tools
================

In this section, tools needed for the implementation of AI will be introduced and several AI problems will be solved with simple programming activities. Examples covers

- implementation and using of intelligent agents
- planning by means of graph theory
- inference
- machine learning

The Exercises are introduced as Jupyter notebooks which contain the introduction of the problem and existing program code which initializes the problem and works as an example, and the student only implements few lines of the most relevant code for solving the problem.
