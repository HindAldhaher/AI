Introduction to AI tools
================

In this section, tools needed for the implementation of AI will be introduced and several AI problems will be solved with simple programming activities. Examples covers

- implementation and using of intelligent agents
- planning by means of graph theory
- inference
- machine learning

## Python 
 - Working with Jupyter notebooks (literate programming)
 - Interaction with Python interpreter
 - Variables, reading input, plotting output
 - Blocks
 - Loops
 - Functions
 - Plotting 
 
## Overview of AI libraries to be covered 

### Logical inference

### Machine learning libraries (Scikit-learn)

### Graph theory libraries (networkx)

## Excercise: Implementation of a simple reflex agent
